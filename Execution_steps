First of all install all dependency of this Project using 
   npm install.
Extract Redis from the folder and run redis server for public subscribe model to use .

Open postman and post request with this url
    http://localhost:3000/api/mine
    and select data like raw and in JSON fromat..

last you have to run the command 
    npm run dev to host 

for the peer node you split your terminal and run the following command for peer node 

   npm run dev-peer // exactly like this only on gap between dev and peer


Anyone (host or peer ) can mine the data in blockchain.
 for host use post url   http://localhost:3000/api/mine
 and provide raw data .

 for peer node to mine  data in   blockchain 
  you just have to change port address to node from which you want ti mine data on the network ..
  when you will run your peer node no terminal you will have port address of peer node just put in url and post request

  ex http://localhost:3000/api/mine  // this is host address for minning data you will change the port address example 3289 (port address of peer)
  http://localhost:3289/api/mine  and mine the data .








http://localhost:3000/mine.html       /// for miner 
http://localhost:3000/            // local host

http://localhost:3000/api/blocks  // views block chain data 

node index.js     // cmd to run on terminal
